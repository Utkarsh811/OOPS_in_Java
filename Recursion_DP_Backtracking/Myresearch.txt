Recursion-: Principle of mathematical induction
DP
Backtracking

f(x)=x^x
assuming f(k)=k^k assuming this statement is truth
now prove f(k+1)=k+1 ^ k+1
and prove f(1)=1^1

to frame recursion we should have do high level thinking




void fun(n)
{
    //whatever be here processed when callstack goes up 

    fun(n-1)
    //whatever be here processed when callstack goes down or returning

}
main()
{
    fun(n);
}
