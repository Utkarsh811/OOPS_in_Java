Some limitations of Arrays-:
1.FIxed size issue.
2. Insertion/Deletion operation at middle location is costly
3. Linear data structure
4. elements are not present in contiguous structure
5. For implementing stacks and queues we use arrays and linked list

*Doubly linked list is very ,uch useful in real life
stacks and queues, Image Processing, Brower nagivation tab, Music Player,HashMap and HashSet


public class SINGLYlinkedlist{

    class Node
    {
        int data;
        Node next;


        public Node(int data)
        {
            this.data=data;
            this.next=null;
        }
    }
}

Head is pointing to the 1st Node
Tail is pointing to the last node
